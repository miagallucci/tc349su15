	<h1> Design Principles - Week 3 </h1>
	<h2> 1. Chunking - Mashable.com </h2>

<p>The Mashable.com website strongly exemplifies the design principle of chunking through the use of 
varying text sizes and separating clickable links with photos for easier processing. A hierarchy 
of text makes some article titles more attention grabbing than others, and the grouping of article titles 
allows for easier focus. </p>
	<h2> 2. Signal-To-Noise Ratio - Elle.com </h2>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/24ugSwD.png">
<p>Elle.com effectively demonstrates the signal-to-noise ratio by displaying the most relevant information first.
The title of each article is short and bolded, with a longer description below in a thin, lighter font.
The overall short amount of text accompanied by an appropriate image quickly informs the reader, which doesn't 
make the person think nearly as hard, and creates a balanced signal-to-noise ratio.  </p>
<h2> 3. Hick's Law - Petco.com </h2>

 <p>With a simple navigation menu, petco.com exemplifies Hick's Law, the design principle associated
with the time it takes to make a decision. Petco.com's simple navigation menu is categorized by pet, which quickly 
reduces the number of decisions that customer is required to make. A customer will likely only browse products related
to the type of animal they own, so it is more efficient for them to search based on animal, rather
than entire product categories for any animal. For instance, if I want to buy a toy for my dog, I don't want to 
search toys for any animal, I only want to see toys made for dogs. </p>
<h2> 4. 80/20 Rule - Time.com </h2>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/0ijbpwh.png">
  <p>At Time.com, the website experience effectively uses the 80/20 rule by positioning and marketing 
the top 20% of content that 80% of their online audience wants to read. While Time.com has hundreds of current 
articles available, and nearly a dozen to feature each day on their homepage, only 20% of the content they generate gets the 
most attention. For example, by positioning the stories about Mohammad Ali's death prominently on 
the front page (arguably their most popular feature article on the given date) Time.com is following the 80/20 rule by promoting 
the top 20% of their content to the 80% majority of readers. On the Time.com homepage, a thin column on the left 
is dedicated to new articles, which most likely get less attention than articles about Mohammad Ali, so they are not given as 
much space on the homepage.</p>
  <h2> 5. Rule of Thirds - NationalGeographic.com </h2>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/VLWYLyI.png">
  <p>The Rule of Thirds is effectively demonstrated on NationalGeographic.com, where a simple homepage composition 
aligns two sections of content on the vertical intersections of thirds. The rule of thirds provides an 
aesthetically pleasing web experience, and simplifies the amount of information a viewer takes in at once. On the 
NationalGeographic.com website, the eye is quickly directed to the content within the two columns, and is easy to scan
for interesting finds.  </p>
