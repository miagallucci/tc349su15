While both the style tile and the full comp provided helpful insights 
to creating my own website homepage design, I prefer using the style 
tile because without it, I would have had a hard time feeling comfortable 
with the overall aestehtic of the style I wanted to choose. The full comp made it easy 
to clearly see all of the parts working together as a whole, but took much longer
(nearly an hour) and would have taken me even longer than that if I had not done a style tile first.
After doing the style tile, I felt more comfortable with the direction and the pieces quickly
fell togther, after spending around 30 minutes on each style tile option. I think realistically it 
is important to do both the full comp and the style tile to make the most of the planning process, 
but I think if I had to choose one method, I would go with the style tile.
